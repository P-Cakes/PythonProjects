My Python re-learning process.

Up to 15: Functional Programming.
Starting with 16 and 17 we have object oriented programming.  

Day 24: File Paths, directories, reading/writing files from python.

Day 32: Learned how to use OS to hide passwords that can be imported as environ.
Messed up gitignore and leaked password file. 
git reset --hard HEAD~3
git push origin +{hash}:main
